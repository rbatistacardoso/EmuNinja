# Project Brief: EmuNinja - Industrial Device Emulator

## 1. Project Goal

To create a versatile software tool, EmuNinja, capable of emulating various industrial devices that communicate over serial (RS232, RS485) and Ethernet (TCP) interfaces. The primary purpose is to facilitate the development and testing of control/monitoring software without requiring physical hardware access.

## 2. Core Requirements

- **Device Emulation:** Simulate device behavior by receiving commands and sending pre-defined or configurable responses.
- **Communication Interfaces:** Support common industrial communication interfaces:
  - Serial (RS232, RS485)
  - Ethernet (TCP/IP)
- **Protocol Support:** Handle various application-level protocols:
  - Raw/Custom ASCII/Binary messages
  - SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments)
  - Modbus RTU (Serial)
  - Modbus TCP (Ethernet)
  - _Extensible to support others._
- **Configurability:** Allow users to easily define command-response mappings, potentially through configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON). Provide default mappings for standard protocols.
- **Scalability & Extensibility:** Design an architecture that allows adding new communication interfaces and protocols with minimal friction.
- **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging of communication exchanges (commands received, responses sent, errors).
- **Testing:** Develop unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.
- **User Interface (Optional but Recommended):** Consider a simple UI (CLI or GUI) for configuration, starting/stopping emulation, and viewing logs.

## 3. Target Users

- Software developers building applications that interact with industrial devices.
- Test engineers validating control/monitoring software.
- System integrators setting up and troubleshooting communication links.

## 4. Key Success Metrics

- Ability to successfully emulate devices using supported interfaces and protocols.
- Ease of configuration for new device profiles.
- Stability and reliability during emulation sessions.
- Clear and useful logging output.
- Well-documented and maintainable codebase.
