# Product Context: EmuNinja

## 1. Problem Solved

Developing and testing software that communicates with industrial hardware (PLCs, sensors, instruments) is often hindered by:

- **Hardware Availability:** Physical devices may be expensive, limited in number, or unavailable during early development stages.
- **Testing Complexity:** Setting up real hardware for comprehensive testing scenarios can be time-consuming and complex.
- **Risk:** Testing against production hardware carries risks.
- **Environment Differences:** Development environments rarely perfectly mirror production environments.

EmuNinja addresses these issues by providing a software-based emulator that mimics the communication behavior of these devices.

## 2. How It Should Work (User Perspective)

1.  **Configure:** The user defines or selects a device profile, specifying:
    - Communication interface (e.g., COM3, 9600 baud, 8N1 or TCP port 502).
    - Application protocol (e.g., Modbus RTU, SCPI, Custom).
    - Command-response mappings (using a simple file format like YAML or JSON). Pre-built mappings for standard protocols should be available.
2.  **Run:** The user starts the EmuNinja emulator for the configured profile.
3.  **Connect:** The user's application connects to EmuNinja as if it were the real device (e.g., connecting to COM3 or TCP port 502).
4.  **Interact:** The application sends commands; EmuNinja receives them, looks up the corresponding response in the configuration, and sends it back.
5.  **Monitor:** The user can view logs of the communication exchange within EmuNinja.
6.  **Stop:** The user stops the emulation when finished.

## 3. User Experience Goals

- **Ease of Use:** Simple configuration and operation.
- **Flexibility:** Support for common interfaces and protocols, with easy extension points.
- **Reliability:** Stable emulation that accurately reflects configured behavior.
- **Transparency:** Clear logging to aid debugging.
